*MARR-HILDRETH:*  
The Marr-Hildreth algorithm detects edges in images by applying a Laplacian-Gaussian filter to identify inflection points (zero-crossings) that correspond to the contours of objects.

***
*CANNY:*  
The Canny algorithm detects edges in images by applying Gaussian smoothing, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis thresholding to define precise contours.

***
*OTSU-METHOD:*  
Otsu's method automatically determines the optimal threshold for segmentation, maximizing the separation between the background and object classes.

*WATERSHED:*  
The watershed algorithm segments an image simulating water filling from local minima, delimiting the edges where the "basins" meet.

*CADEIA DE FREEMAN:*  
The Freeman chain encodes the contour of an object as a sequence of discrete directions, facilitating the analysis and comparison of shapes.

***
*BOX FILTER:*  
The box filter replaces each pixel with the average of the values ​​in a surrounding window, smoothing the image.

***
*PIXEL SEGMENTATION:*  
Pixel segmentation based on a threshold table assigns each pixel to a category by comparing its value against a predefined sequence of thresholds to separate regions of interest.
